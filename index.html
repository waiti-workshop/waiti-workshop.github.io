    <p>
        The AI for Cyber Threat Intelligence (WAITI) Workshop will be held on Monday, December 9, 2024, in conjunction with the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC). 
        ACSAC will be held in Hawaii, USA. We have merged the IoT Security and Cyber Threat Intelligence (IoT-SCTI) Workshop with WAITI to cater to a wider audience.

    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>

        The cybersecurity landscape constantly shifts, throwing a never-ending data stream at security professionals. 
        Valuable threat intelligence is hidden within this large stream, including text reported in social media, technical reports, and dark web forums. 
        Traditionally, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relied on manual analysis or basic keyword matching, leading to bottlenecks and missed opportunities. 
        Security analysts face limitations in the sheer volume of data, sophistication in tactics like code obfuscation and social engineering, and the rapid evolution of threats necessitates real-time processing to stay ahead of attackers. 
        In today's digital landscape, where the volume and complexity of data continue to escalate, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and large language models have emerged as indispensable tools for deciphering and mitigating cyber threats. 
        NLP empowers machines to understand and process human language, offering significant benefits for CTI such as automated processing, advanced threat detection, and real-time analysis, allowing immediate threat identification and response. 
        Thus, extracting and analyzing this information efficiently is critical for proactive defense strategies. This workshop explores the exciting potential of Artificial Intelligence/Generative AI to revolutionize cybersecurity, particularly CTI gathering and analysis. 
        The workshops will provide a platform for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to delve deeper into specialized topics related to NLP, Large Language Models (LLMs), and, more in general, artificial intelligence techniques in the context of cybersecurity and cyber threat intelligence.
